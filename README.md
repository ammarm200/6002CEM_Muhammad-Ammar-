**Task Todo Notes Mobile Application**
I have developed a Task Todo Notes Application for my 6002CEM Modules.User can use this app to write down his daily tasks and can use it as a notes application as well.The Motivation behind creating this application is my personal struggles to remain productive and organised in my daily busy life.I was always managing a lot of projects, assignments, and personal responsibilities when I was a college student . My changing schedule was simply too much for the old-fashioned pen and paper approach, as well as the basic digital tools I tried.After starting this module and when i get to know about coursework I came to the conclusion that there had to be a more effective and user-friendly method for me to organise my tasks and notes,so I decided  to create an app that would help others going through same difficulties in addition to fitting my own need.This application is mainly about doing two things at once: it combines the ease of use of a to-do list with the use of note-taking. Users' productivity process is made easier by this special combination, which ensures that they can record their ideas and tasks in a single integrated platform. The following is an overview of the features of the app, which are made to meet a variety of organisational requirements:

**Simple to Add New Tasks:** Adding new tasks is simple due to a simple interface. It really is that easy: just type and go.
**Securely Save Tasks:** You can always access your tasks and never worry about losing your data because they are securely stored.
**Delete Tasks:** Tasks can be easily deleted if they are finished or no longer needed, which will help you maintain a current and useful list.
**Include a Deadline:** Including a deadline feature in your work will help you better manage your time and prevent last-minute rushes when you have tasks with set deadlines.
**Mark task as completed:** You feel like you're making progress and achieved something when you cross things off your list.
**Pin Tasks:** By keeping your most important tasks visible at all times, you can ensure that you never forget anything.
**Mark as Important:** This function lets you draw attention to tasks that need extra care so they stand out from the rest.
**Filter by Category:** The filter feature makes your list more manageable by allowing you to concentrate on one category at a time.
**Delete All Completed Tasks:** This cleanup function helps you maintain an organised and current list by allowing you to delete all completed tasks at once.

My goal for this app was to make it easy to use, but strong enough to deal with the daily tasks of life. With this app, you can manage all of your tasks in one location whether you're a professional, student, or just trying to stay organised. Just as it has helped me, I hope it also helps others find clarity and productivity in daily life.
